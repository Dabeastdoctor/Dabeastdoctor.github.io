    <td>It was quite exciting to move ahead and incorporate all of my skills that I learned before into one exercise. I learnt a couple more commands and inputs, such as RND (random), and CLR (clear), and others. I found that my strategies to learn will quite effective meaning that I could go right through all of the exercises and it help that my partner was reading out the instructions so that I could type quickly and realise what was happening and in the script. All in all, my strategies and the way I learned were quite effective, I found, and I could work fast with my partner.</td>

    <td>My ability to understand and write the script and correct words quickly and efficiently but I think this isn't much of a struggle to work on because I just need to be able to use logic to find out what each word means. I'm making my script more complicated in order to incorporate more skills and things I've learnt into my work. To work on my habit of not using capital letters and lowercase letters correctly because now I know that computers are very case sensitive and words with a capital letter mean different things than a word as a lowercase letter. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I want to improve my learning by realising that capital letters and lowercase letters have to be used separately and to not mix them up in my work and I will learn prove this by making sure and proof checking my script to make sure that I use the correct letters in the correct places and make sure that my variables are spelt exactly the same. I want to change my way of learning so that I can move on and do the correct things when needed.  </td>
