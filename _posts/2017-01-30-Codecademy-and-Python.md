    <td>I learned by reading the text and making sure that I was following the instructions properly and I made sure that the code that I was putting into the machine was correct. I used all the correct punctuation and capital letters, and I thought about everything that was being thought, not unlike this blog actually. I found that just reading and writing was effective, and that if I just followed what was being said after thinking about it, I was more likely of getting it correct. I wanted to make sure that I was learning and making progress at a good rate. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that taking time to read the text and understanding it stopped me from learning all that I could have. I need to work on being quicker and generally not wasting time. I think that I made a fairly good amount of progress in the lesson but I think I could have done more to help me learn and this could be achieved by making sure that I type quickly but carefully and taking in all the new information that is being put in my face as it is a new coding language.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my speed of writing as I think that I am making enough progress that I should have made last lesson, but I think I covered it in homework time. I think that I should be aiming to finish the course in about 4 lessons including homework time, as I am moving quickly but, in my opinion, not quickly enough, because I really want to move on to another language, e.g. JavaScript (I have started JavaScript on my own and I am finding it roughly similar to Python.) In conclusion I think that I am making lists of progress but I want to change my speed to make it better to learn with and make progress quickly. </td>
