In our previous lesson, we talked about how exams were all based on memory and not actual skill. We also discussed how you had to retake a core subject exam again and again until you passed it. 

The tests that we are given now just test our memory recall, as we are just asked to regurgitate facts and knowledge on some paper. The coursework that existed until last year was good, as it allowed us to use our skills practically and demonstrate them. 

Also, the fact that you only had to retake a test that you failed, and had to take it again and again if it was a core subject was not a good decision. This is because some people do not like this, and some people have different amounts of skill in each subject. If drama became a core subject, and you had to retake it until you pass, not many people would be happy. 

Anyway, thanks for reading
