  <tr>
    <td>I think that my willingness to give up my time to help others is what is limiting my learning despite it being a nice thing. Also. I need to work on my understanding of the language, as no one who is on my percentage actually understands what they are doing, so I just have to struggle or ask Mr. Keen. </td>

    <td>I will work on my willingness to help, as even though it is a good thing, it is what is hindering my learning. I will improve my learning by actually understanding the instructions and carrying out them carefully. </td>
