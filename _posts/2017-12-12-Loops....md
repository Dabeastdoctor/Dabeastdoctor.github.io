This week we decided to work on loops, and the different types of loops. 

There are 2 main types: 'while' and ‘for’.

The while loop is simple, but has its own cons:

* Carries on forever until you break the loop. This could be by making  a condition and a variable, such as 

a=1

While a=1:

* Can't be done for a certain amount of time, unlike for loops.

The for loop is good, because it allows us to do something a certain amount of times, but if you have range(12), then the count will go from 0 to 11. That's still 12 numbers but it only goes to 11. 

Anyways. The homework this week was relatively easy, but the coding aspect was tricky. 

Thanks for reading.
