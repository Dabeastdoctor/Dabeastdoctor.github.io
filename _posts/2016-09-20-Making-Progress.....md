    <td>I managed to finally find out how to save something and I also managed to finish off the second task and I started the 3rd. My strategies for learning were effective, but I could have improved by checking my work, because I made a couple of errors. I need to try to make sure that I don't make silly mistakes such as missing a line or misspelling a word by accident. To be honest, I think that I do have the capability, but mistakes like this hold me back. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on checking my work every 2-3 minutes. This is to avoid mistakes like the things that I did. If I can do my work next week, without any problems, then I will have known that I have improved. I learnt how to save work efficiently, which is to save the work on my memory stick instantly. Then I need to update it at the end, and have the finished code on my memory stick by the end of the lesson. This is my target for next week. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to change my habit of not checking my work as this is preventing me from moving ahead with my work. I am still quite far ahead, but one pair is on pg 41 and this is very good. I need to pick up the pace and start coding faster and more efficiently, making my progress move at a rapid rate, although I need to be careful, as if I move on faster, but don't learn anything there won't be a point of doing it. I think I am working fine, as I am learning everything that I do. To conclude, my learning is fine, even though I will change my checking habits to improve for next time. </td>
