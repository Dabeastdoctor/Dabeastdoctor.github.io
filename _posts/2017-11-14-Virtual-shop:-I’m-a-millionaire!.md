So, in last week's lesson, we started to create our virtual shop. 

It was really fun, deciding what I'd sell and how much of a rip off it’d be. In the end I went for a classic Indian curry house for comical reasons. I thought about how to do the code and it came to me by just plain logic and I found it immensely fun and interesting to see what’d happen if I did something such as just change the price of something or add a load of discounts, so it went over 100%. I could predict the results and it was good to find that my mind could work in such a way to find out what how the computer worked and thought. 

Progress goes like this: I started off with nothing and I now have a working shop, fully decorated and I have a sale option and a discount voucher option, and I didn't struggle doing it. I want there to be something like adding more shops and finding the total amount of money that I'd make if I opened more shops. I could think about the staff and how much they’re paid or even the air conditioning. 

I think that I could just repeat the current sheet on more sheets so that I have a franchise of shops and then I could have a final sheet which takes all the money and adds it together then takes away expenses to find total profit. 

Anyways,

That's all.  

See you next time.
