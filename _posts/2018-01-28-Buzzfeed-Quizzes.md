Hi.

We are going to start Buzzfeed Quiz like coding. Mr Keen asked us to google a quiz, and do it, and take in everything we knew the program was doing. I chose a quiz to do with dogs..

I have decided to make my program like this, but on designer brands. There will be one right answer, and 4 or five wrong answers. If you an answer wrong, but it was close to the right one, you will still get points, but less than what you would get if you got the answer right.

Here is a very brief overview on how we have started to plan our project:

MATHS

9 questions Start on 0. For each question, each option will have a weight, the wrong answers will have 0 weight or negative weight, and the correct answer will have the heaviest weight. There will be score brackets, such as 1-10, 11-20. Each bracket will have a description and a name, such as 1-10 will have "You don't know designer brands at all!" We will add up all of the weights and that will create the score for the brackets.

There will be about 10 questions with 5 possible answers, which means i will need to program 50 answers.

This is the start of a long process which will take about half a term.

These questions will be:

1. When was Gucci created

2. Which two letters do the Louis Vuitton Logo include

3. What brand has recently collaborated with Nike to create a version on Vapor maxes and Jordans?

4. Which brand has a horse for their logo?

5. Which brand has a crocodile as their logo?

6. Which brand has an eagle as their logo, with the letters GA?

7. Which brand has white and red in their logo?

8. Which brand has medusa as their logo?

9. What brand is YSL?

10. Which brand has a knight riding a horse?

Well here's the code:
