    <td>I listened carefully to the things that Mr Keen was judging us on and when he showed us some blog examples from his half of the class, I made a mental note on what looked good and what didn't. I listened to the guidelines of what a good blog is and how you should write your blog posts. I needed to, from these guidelines, make my blog site nicer aesthetically. I need to make sure I am using the Language of Learning in the front of my planner. This will make by blog posts deeper and more thoughtful.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that probably limited by blog from being the best it could be by changing my colour scheme and adding in the tables that it should have in order for this template to work. If I add this my blog will be a lot better in quality and as I said in the previous section, aesthetics. I need to work on my level of understanding in these blog posts. I have to go into more depth and detail about how I can improve my blog and blog posts, making sure that I haven't missed any major details out about the lesson and the way that I learned and how I am going to move on from that lesson. I have had to restart my blog and pick a new template, because my old template does not have the required code for tables, so that I could edit it and I do not know where to add the piece of code into the style.scss section.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my blog completely, so that it looks different and feels different, with it looking better than my old blog. I still need to work on the blog a bit, because there seemed to be a bug, where the colour of the background does not change if I make the code in the style.scss section different. In the style.scss, there is one colour and in the page there is a different colour, so that needs to be addressed. I will improve my blog posts by making them more in depth and detailed, so that the blog post is nice to read and is deep and really looks into how I am feeling about my progress. I think that all these things need to be looked at, so that I can get the best post and page I possibly can. </td>
