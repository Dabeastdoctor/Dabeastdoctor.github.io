So. Another week and and another blog. I'm quite happy with my progress. But the issue is that trying to get a buy one get one free offer working is very hard and is took me forever. My multiple tries have all ended in formula issues like a formula syntax error, but I have done it finally. I mean, it isn't perfect but as far as I’m concerned, it works despite it only counting if you have asked for an even number of the certain product with the deal. 

Something's better than nothing, I guess. 

Apart from that, I added some more items and am planning to add some prices for buying in and that allows me to calculate profit. It's relatively easy and I’m going to try to do it in the first 10 minutes of the next lesson.

I guess that's all for this week,

See you next time
