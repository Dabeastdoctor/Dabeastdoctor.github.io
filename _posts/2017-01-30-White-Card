    <td>I learnt by making sure that I was using the correct code and trying to move as quickly as possible. I tried to finish the tasks in the lessons so that I could move on to something else and learn more about different languages in coding. The work was getting progressively harder and I am starting to struggle more, but that shouldn't be a problem as I will try to solve whatever problem I am having in the most logical, clever way. I found that using my brain to think about the problems helps a lot.</td>

    <td>I think that my way of looking at the work is making my job harder. In the lesson, I was struggling and had tried to work on the section for quite a while and so I asked Mr Keen and said that I had tried everything, who in turn said that if he found something wrong, I would receive a white card. He found something and wrote out a white card. At the end of the lesson he left it and wrote a good note in my planner about my learning. He told me to be more careful with my choice of words and that I should think about what I say. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my view of the work and my selection of words so that such a situation does not arise again. I will make sure that I do as much as I can before asking Mr. Keen. I will try to improve my learning by trying to look at the code in different angles so that I can work out the meaning of the instructions. In conclusion I need to work on choosing my words so that I am not putting forward a false claim and to look at the code so that I can do as much as I can before having to ask someone.</td>
