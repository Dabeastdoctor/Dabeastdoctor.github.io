(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, as I managed to use the technique to separate my code into bits. </td>

    <td>I don't do use the correct version of writing down code in order to make sure that my code is neat and understandable to someone who didn't know what they were doing I also managed to make sure that it was right to the point to make sure that I didn't have any spelling errors or capital letters in the wrong place. The strategies were effective because I read the book and managed to get the correct code without messing up so therefore I found out that my work and helped my learning.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my habit of writing it as one line. I need to write it in two or three chunks moved across the page so that it looks a lot neater and cleaner and I think I've only done the strategy that I've just named in this week's work so I need to do it all the time. My learning was limited when I didn't follow the book correctly and instead did what I wanted which was to do the text in one big chunk instead off a couple of little ones and this made it a lot more harder to read.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Altens the way that I write my text on for next time so that it's a lot neater and it's a lot more organised and I can make sure that I follow the book and make sure I don't fail at writing down the code correctly. I will do this by following the book word for word and making sure I don't make any silly errors in my work by checking through at the end looking for is in the wrong place or not at all and spelling errors. Also I need to check my work so I can finish the most work possible in the least time; therefore I can learn a lot more.</td>
