  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by making sure that I had used all the resources I had to hand before asking Mr. Keen to avoid a situation like last time. I used a mixture of the codecademy glossary, my own knowledge and asking my friends, before asking about something. I apparently had some syntax wrong and I had found this out from the Glossary and the error message that showed up. In order to prevent me getting stuck like this, I think that I need to read more carefully and try to be more cautious when writing up my work. I need to check after as well, because I have learnt that even a capital letter or one full-stop can cause an error. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that my checking for mistakes is what is limiting my learning, as I think that I don't check enough, to prevent small errors that could have been easily stopped. I also think that my independence lets me down, as if I want to alter the code a little, say like instead of 'sorry', I write ‘that is not a word’ and then it causes a syntax error. I think that these things can be easily prevented and no have to be corrected later. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my way of checking my work, so that I still check but I will also check whilst typing (if that makes any sense). I will improve my learning this way, as I will have more time in the lesson to move on and learn more things. I think that having time is important as it lets you learn for longer and lets you make more progress. </td>
