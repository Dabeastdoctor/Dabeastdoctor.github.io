  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by making sure that I had a good strategy and for me, that is to read slowly and cautiously and then code, and if anything is wrong then think long and hard before correcting it. I think that this strategy is effective as it allowed me to make sure that I can learn by correcting my mistakes and trying not to make the same mistake again, for example, putting a colon after an if/elif/else statement. In my opinion, I think that my strategy is good, but I think that it is somewhat flawed as sometimes even the text does not provide all the information needed. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that something that limited my learning is that I keep making dumb errors e.g. Punctuation or spelling. These things can be easily prevented as I can just proofread it once again, so I need to work on proofreading my work and my code before pressing 'Save and Continue'. I really think that I am slowing my learning by not proofreading enough. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way in which that I use my time as I need to spend some time proofreading each section, and this will improve my learning as I will stop making stupid mistakes with punctuation and spelling which just ruin my chance of making more progress.</td>
