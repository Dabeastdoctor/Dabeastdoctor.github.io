In Computational Thinking, the new name for IT - given by Mr. Tansley, we have been working on spreadsheets. 

Despite my need to restart about 3 times, I think that i'm doing well. I have successfully encoded a basic message and the  decoded it successfully. I think that I am progressing at a steady rate at which I will be able to make lots of progress. 

But in all honesty, I believe that I am stuck. This is because of the fact that I don't understand some things, i.e. how to put images into a blog posts (but I have a basic idea of how to do it). Also I just donâ€™t get why all the errors arise in the spreadsheet, but apart from all that I am quite happy with the way things are going. 

Last lesson we learnt how to concatenate. This is done by using the '**=****CONCATENATE**'**_ _**formula. This puts all the text from a selection of cells into one cell. After this what we had to do was spread the all out again and make sure that we could decode it again. If we managed this then we had a working-decode encode system. 

That's all I have to report today, thanks for reading and bye!
