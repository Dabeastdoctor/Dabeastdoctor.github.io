    <td>My strategies were effective as my partner and I managed to finish the section relatively quickly (>100 lines of code in 2 weeks of IT lessons). It also allowed me to recall the skills that I have learned over the last couple of weeks, so I could combine all of them and make 1 piece of code that worked well and was also humorous as we, after finished all the code from the book, decided to take the code on its own journey, and we changed some lines and added some lines, so it made the game which was the result of the code more fun to play and better to look at than the original code. My partner and I also talked about each command and line to see what they were doing to the code as a whole. </td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my speed, as I think that I spent too much time on individually analysing each line of code, and therefore couldn't finish it quickly enough. This was probably the biggest struggle this lesson, but there were others, such as again, struggling to get a chair quickly, but this was only a minor issue. I will work the first issue by quickly skimming over the code once in awhile, but still check the code for any errors. This is something that I am working hard to do but finding it difficult, as I want my code to be perfect but also to have some momentum whilst working. </td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my speed of working to make more progress in the book and write code quicker. This will ultimately, lead me to learn more in a smaller space of time. I will improve my learning by doing the above, and trying to work better as a team with my partner, as I think that we are not helping each other enough, so I will try to help him and myself by  reading out of the book precisely and carefully, as to not make any mistakes.</td>
