  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that my tactic is somewhat mediocre as I didn't really make any more progress than normal. I think that another strategy that's also effective is doing work whilst reading, so I work while reading the necessary bits. I learnt by doing the same thing as I have said before, and this is when I realised that this is not a good strategy.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I have already established, my technique of completing the work was hindering my progress and my learning. I need to work on my concentration as I think that I am getting sidetracked in my work by helping others, which isn't a bad thing, or talking to others, which can be a bad thing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my way of working and the way I do my work. I will improve by making sure that my work is top quality, and that I don't get distracted from my work. I will change my attitude toward the work so that I don't lose time in which I could and should have made progress, even though I am ahead of the class by quite a bit. </td>
