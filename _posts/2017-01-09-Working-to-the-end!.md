  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by rereading the text many times to figure out the code and where the wires and so on needed to go. I made sure that they were all connected and we managed to get the first bit done. In retrospect, our method was one of trial and error, where we made an error and tried to fix it by guessing. This wasn't the best but it worked and we finished the section.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the book was limiting, as it’s images of the wire configuration were not clear as to the wire’s location. This didn't help as if they were more descriptive, then we wouldn't had to have used our trial and error method, although there might’ve been something wrong with the way that they were plugged into the breadbox. I need to work on my independence and lessen my reliability on the book.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to change by trying to interpret the book, as in if I don't understand a phrase, instead of asking someone, just picking the most likely option, although asking someone is another good method. I will improve by making sure, as I have said in countless other blogs, I don't waste time. This will make sure that I don't lose time in which I could be making progress.</td>
