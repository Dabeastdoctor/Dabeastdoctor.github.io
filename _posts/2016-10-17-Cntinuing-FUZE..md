    <td>This week I used a mixture of the techniques from last week and new ones. I think it was easier to read out and figure out what I needed to type for me, as Joe and I were careful on what I was typing so I understand every single word. It made me have less progress, but I think I learnt more than before. I also learnt that we could do more things on the actual FUZE box, like change the colour of the editor or the size of the font. </td>

  <th> What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Things that limited my learning included extremely silly stuff like taking 10 minutes to get ready and get chairs out of the next room. I need to work on being more efficient of a person, in order to solve these simple problems. If I do, I can get more learning time in, so I can make more progress.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change by making sure to grab all the required equipment quickly and quietly, so there is a lot more time to actually get in with the coding. It will make myself a better coder, as I will learn more and I will do this by, instantly grabbing a chair for myself and grabbing the equipment. I would then proceed to connect everything up. This would allow for more time to learn and make progress.</td>
