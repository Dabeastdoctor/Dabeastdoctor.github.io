  <tr>
    <td>My strategy was the same. The change I wade was that this time, I made a 50/50 split between my own work and other's as I think that helping others is an important part of learning and that if you help others, it will help you to start thinking more due to the fact that in my case I am ahead of the others in my class and I have to revisit places that I have not been in lots of time, and answer the question by looking at the error message and my own memory.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the thing that limited my learning is my hunger to move on. The reason is that I am pushing myself too far and too fast. I think that this is my downfall as it means that I am sticking to the tough belief that I can always improve, when in fact I am doing well enough. I am still ahead of the whole class and I am doing a good job of my lessons and learning from my mistakes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my mindset for meet time, as I need to stop with my belief that I can always improve and always do better, and this will help me by making sure that I actually am learning while having some fun. This is good, as I will enjoy doing this and I will naturally want to do more. </td>
