    <td>I think that I could have done better as I could have read in between the lines and understood more of what was being asked of me, instead of just asking Mr. Keen. I think that my strategy was not that great, and I am still on the hunt for the best strategy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were mainly not in between reading the lines. I need to work on this as I needed to ask Mr. Keen for help 3 times and this could have been easily avoided by just reading a bit more. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my reading as if I read on between the lines, I can understand the instructions more easily and follow them more carefully. I will improve my learning as I don't need to wait for Mr. Keen to come round and I can just get on with my own work. </td>
