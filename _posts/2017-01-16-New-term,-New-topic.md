    <td>I learnt by using both screens and looking at the code of my blog looking for mistakes. On the smaller screen I had W3 schools up and on the other I had my GitHub repo. I copied the code for drop shadows and it ended up giving me drop shadows for all the containers. This made my blog a mess and it was not nice in any way at all. I ended up fixing it in IT club on Wednesday. Mr Keen told me to give it 12 hours and I did, with it not making a difference. It looked as if it was taking information from a non existent piece of code. I eventually found the problem and dealt with it. It was giving drop shadows to something other than the tables and it was not the desired look. I found that just skimming through code to spot any mistakes like missing spaces, etc. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

  <tr>
    <td>I think the mistake with the drop shadow held me back as it stopped me from making any more progress and this wasn't great. I went to IT club to get my blog fixed, but I realised at the club that even 2 letters can make the difference between a broken blog and a great one. I need to work on being careful so I don't make mistakes when I'm actually doing the code so I don't need to go back and fix it. Also I need to work on advanced code, e.g. Changing the fonts or getting 2 different fonts in the table. I think W3 schools is going to help me to do this but I want to ask Mr Keen about what I can do to my blog to make it an outstanding blog.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change by being more careful with my code and checking what I am actually copying into my style.SCSS. I want to improve by making my blog more advanced and using pieces of code that will enhance my code. This will help me because then I will have a more attractive and effective blog page. I will change my blog by using rounded corners and maybe I should use some transparency in the footer. I think that the colours I have chosen, a greeny-blue and a purple work well so I am not going to change that. </td>
