So. 

After 10 weeks of IT lessons with Mr T, I've thoroughly enjoyed myself and now I’ve moved on to coding with Mr Keen… It’s fun, but I know I can’t ask a question without half asking for another repeat of the White Card blog.

This week, what I've done is try to create a conversation with a computer. I’ve tried to program a couple of questions and they worked, for the most part. 

The computer is giving me an error, even though the same code in a different section worked perfectly fine. I've tried to retype it, and I’ve also tried it without the section and it works perfectly fine. 

I don't know how to make it work. I’ll try my best but I don’t know.

Anyways,

See ya later. 

Anish.
