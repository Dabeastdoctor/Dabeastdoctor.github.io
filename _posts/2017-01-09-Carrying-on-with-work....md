    <td>We learned quite quickly, using techniques that we had learned over the last few weeks. I think that we had really made some progress as we had started to use the electronics box to put together some basic circuits that allowed the LED to light up if you put in a certain bit of code. Overall, we could have been quicker, but I think as it was the first time that we were using the kit, we were allowed to be slightly slow. Joe and I worked together well, correcting each other as we went along, but I think we could have been more effective. I think that the book is a bit vague in its instructions, and that is what slowed us down.</td>

    <td>I think the fact that the book was a little bit vague was limiting and that it could have detailed more and could have included a diagram in how the wires are meant to be in the FUZE box, as we spent a long time discussing the picture and now the wires were aligned. In the end we made it, but I think we could have improved on that. Also, there are many thing that we could have easily done quicker, like instead of asking Mr Keen if we could take a kit, just taking one. </td>

    <td>I will try and be more independent and use my initiative in order to move on and do more things. If I can perform this, then I will possibly learn more and and learn faster. These little things make a difference and maybe I will progress forward in the book. I really want to progress as this week I saw that there is a second book in the boxes, and that some people are already using it. If I can catch up to them, I will be very pleased and if I can learn a lot in the process then that's even better.</td>
